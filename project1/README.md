# ENPM673 Project 1
This repository implement some of the features related to AR detection and tracking

For more implementation details, read the report in the same directory.

## Run
problem 1.a
```
python3 problem1a.py
```

problem 1.b
```
python3 problem1a.py
```

problem 2.a
```
python3 problem2a.py
```

## Notice
All the programs reads the frame images from the frame directory instead of directly reading from the video.  
This is because of high failure rate and slow speed of the implemented corner detetion methonds. 
Therefore all the results and output are using only a portion of the frame images from the video to show the concept. 

Gernerate the frame images before running programs.
To generate the images run
```
python3 problem1a.py
```
